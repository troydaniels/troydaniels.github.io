I have so many good courses in my inbox right now - and people have even been nice enough to send me ones they figure I might like - but first up I really want to tackle this one - Stanford's [Information Retrieval and Web Search].

[Information Retrieval and Web Search]: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs276/

The end touches on machine learning, which will lead nicely into the course(s) to follow.

Time to break out that Java.
