Well, first project. Lets write a compiler.

Ill be referring to [this text], which was developed for use by the University of Copenhagen in their introductory compiler course.

I'll be working through these chapters, their problem sets, and build a small compiler, documenting my thoughts and progress here.


This topic is something I'm familiar with, having taken a similar course at UNSW - albeit, years ago. Details are fuzzy, and I'm excited to learn more.

First up, lexical analysis.
