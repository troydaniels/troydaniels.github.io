The problem now is that I have *so many* good courses sitting in my inbox, and choosing one to work on is hard.

For a while now, I've wanted to learn a functional language. So that's what im going to do.
I'm going to work through [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good], and then look to complete the popular [Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems].

[Learn You A Haskell for Great Good]: http://learnyouahaskell.com/
[Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems]: http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html

Time to tackle the literal Y combinator.


*Edit - I got totally distracted by life/a job in Tasmania/my first consulting gig (!) that I let this blog go.
No time like the present to push on though...
